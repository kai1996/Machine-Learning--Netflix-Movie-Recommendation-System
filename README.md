# Machine-Learning--Netflix-Movie-Recommendation-System

This project includes the algorithm to develop a Recommendation system using the dataset that was provided for the Netflix Prize Context in 2006. The contest ended long ago but originally had a million dollar prize to develop the best collaborative filtering algorithm to recommend relevant movies to users. 

We tried to tackle this problem by using a basic collaborative filtering algorithm and used a Pearson's R algorithm to predict the movies for a given user. This works by first predicting ratings of the movies that haven't been watched by a user and then recommends the movies with the highest predicted ratings i.e. movies predicted to have highest satisfaction for the user.  

The dataset is included in this folder. However, it can also be found at https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data
